# Snake Game

This is a classic **Snake Game** implemented in Java, using the `javax.swing` package for the graphical user interface. The game allows the player to control a snake that consumes food, grows longer, and avoids collisions with its own body or the walls. As a fun addition, the food blinks to make the game more engaging.

## Features

- **Snake Movement**: Controlled via arrow keys (up, down, left, right).
- **Blinking Food**: The food alternates between visible and invisible, adding a visual challenge to the game.
- **Score Tracking**: Score increases as the snake consumes more food.
- **Collision Handling**: The game ends if the snake collides with its own body or the game board's edges.
- **Game Loop**: A timer-based game loop ensures smooth gameplay and regular updates to the screen.

## Gameplay

- **Objective**: Eat as much food as possible to grow the snake.
- **Controls**:
  - Use the arrow keys to move the snake.
  - The snake grows longer with each food item it consumes.
  - Avoid collisions with the walls or your own snake body.
- **Game Over**: The game will end if the snake runs into a wall or collides with itself.
